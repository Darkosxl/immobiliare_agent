there are two different types of reaching out:

1 - hour messaging
2 - offline/online hour phone calls

- directly lets you book google calendar meetings, tell you about a house (optional) all it has to do, and works during off hours (voice AI)
- reads noreply@immobiliare.it (also other providers) and replies to the messages.

the only type that can't be accessed by AI is the online hour phone calls.
